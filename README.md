### Quick Start

The simplest use-case is present the image picker on your controller:

```swift
ADPhotoKitUI.imagePicker(present: self) { (assets, origin) in
    // do something
}
```

Also you can present the image pricker on swiftUI:

```
import SwiftUI

struct SwiftUIView: View {
    
    @State private var showImagePicker = false
    
    var body: some View {
        Button("PickerImage") {
            showImagePicker.toggle()
        }
        .imagePicker(isPresented: $showImagePicker,
                     selected: { (assets, origin) in
            // do something
        })
    }
}
```

### More Advanced Example

Select up to 9 images or videos:

```swift
ADPhotoKitUI.imagePicker(present: self,
                          params: [.maxCount(max: 9)],
                        selected: { (assets, origin) in
    // do something
})
```

Select 1 video or 9 images:

```swift
ADPhotoKitUI.imagePicker(present: self,
                       assetOpts: .exclusive,
                          params: [.maxCount(max: 9),.imageCount(min: nil, max: 9),.videoCount(min: nil, max: 1)],
                        selected: { (assets, origin) in
    // do something
})
```

Select max 8 images:

```swift
ADPhotoKitUI.imagePicker(present: self,
                       albumOpts: [.allowImage],
                       assetOpts: .exclusive,
                          params: [.maxCount(max: 8)],
                        selected: { (assets, origin) in
    // do something
})
```

Browser network image and video:

```swift
ADPhotoKitUI.assetBrowser(present: self, 
                           assets: [NetImage(url: "https://example.com/xx.png"), NetVideo(url: "https://example.com/xx.mp4")]) { assets in
    // do something
